// this class is needed since the threads need to modify the same space in memory.
// primitives in java are "pass by value" so pointing all threads to an int is akin to
// pointing the threads to temporary places in memory.
// objects in java are "pass by reference" so, even though a "bank account" is simply one integer,
// all the threads will point to the same place in memory if passed an object
